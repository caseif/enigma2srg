# enigma2srg

enigma2srg is a utility program for converting deobfuscation mappings generated by [Enigma] [enigmaForum] to the SRG
format.

## Compiling

enigma2srg uses Gradle for compilation. To build the project, simply run `./gradlew` (`gradlew` on Windows) in the
project directory.

## Running

To use enigma2srg, invoke the JAR file from the command line, providing the Enigma mapping file as a parameter. The SRG
mappings will be sent to standard output, whereupon they may be piped into a file.
